## today's lab is used to practice using Observables to get data from sever side. Since we haven't learnt how to create server side, we choose Random User APIs which is a free and easy to use service to generate random user data for application testing.

Read Random User APIs, then create a html page to display employees.

Here is the difference from yesterday's lab

  # 1. MUST use Observables
  # 2. Provide an input for users to fetch specific number of employees they want
  # 3. Display employees' full name and location/address on the page



  # The below is an example of the appearance of the html page. You don't need to have the same style. The importance is the feature.
